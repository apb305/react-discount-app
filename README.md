## Discounts Application

A small discount application written in ReactJS that's used to find deals in your area. This app connects to an api from Discountsapi.com. I used Boostrap for css just so that I can get to project up and running quickly to focus more on the functionality of the application. It's still a work in progress and I'll be adding more to it overtime.
